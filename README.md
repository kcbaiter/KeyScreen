# KeyScreen
A compact and lightweight keychain device powered by the TTGO T-Display, designed to run select mini-games, display GIFs, show static images, and support various lightweight interactive visuals.

This project aims to blend embedded fun with everyday carry, delivering a pocket-sized platform for retro gaming and media display on an always-accessible keychain.
